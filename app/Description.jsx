            The story of Baby the Deer has gone viral, with many people
            supporting his return to Tommy Bailey, who rescued him as a fawn and
            has cared for him for a year. At the time of the incident, Babyâ€™s
            unusual behavior sparked conversation among residents of Bristol,
            leading to a response from wildlife authorities (initially
            considering rehabilitation, though charges were later dropped).

          <p>
            On March 4, the Game Commission confirmed Baby was taken to a
            licensed facility for permanent care, but did not disclose its
            location or provide an update on his condition.
